  *Operators*
  Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
  Comparison operators: ==, !=, ===, !==, >, >=, <, <=
  Logical operators: &&, ||, !
  Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
  Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
  Conditional (ternary) operator: ? :
  Nullish coalescing operator: ?? /null undefined
  Optional chaining operator: ?.
  Nullish coalescing assignment operator: ??=
  Logical nullish assignment operator: ||=
  Unary operator - incrementation, decrementation, delete (one argument)
  Coma operator - allows declaring multiple vars at once
    let a = 7, b = 10;
    console.log(b); // 10

  let result = (2 + 5) * 10;
  2, 5, 10 are operands
  + oraz * are operators
  2 + 5 is a arithmetic expression
