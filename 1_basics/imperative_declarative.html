  <title>imperative vs declarative programming</title>

  const IMPERATIVE = `
  Imperative programming is about how you do something.
   You define the steps that change the program's state. for loops are a good example of this style.
   In this example, you are explicitly managing the loop counter (i), the loop condition (i < numbers.length), and the state of the squares array.
   `

  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const squares = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    squares.push(numbers[i] * numbers[i]);
  }

  console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


  const DECLARATIVE =  `
  Declarative programming is about what you want to achieve.
  You describe the desired outcome without explicitly listing the steps to get there.
  forEach is more declarative because it abstracts away the control flow.
  Example using forEach loop (Declarative):
  In this example, you are not concerned with the loop counter or the loop condition.
  You simply describe that for each number in numbers, you want to push its square  to the squares array.
  `

  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const squares = [];

  numbers.forEach(number => {
    squares.push(number * number);
  });

  console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

  const SUMMARY = `
Imperative: Focuses on how to achieve something by explicitly defining the steps (e.g., for loop).
Declarative: Focuses on what you want to achieve by describing the desired outcome (e.g., forEach loop).
