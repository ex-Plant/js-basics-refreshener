  const theory1 = `
JS is single threaded! We can easily create an infinite loop that would block the entire program for example:

while (true) {
}

Events, like clicks etc. will not work until loop is over. The browser will freeze.
JS is executing code line by line (synchronous) but we can use some asynchronous features of js as well.

Asynchronous code will be executed last even if timeout is set to 0:
  `
  console.log(`msg 1`); // 1

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`msg 2`);
  },0) //3

  console.log(`msg 3`); // 2

  const theory2 = `Here first the loop will execute 10000 times and ony then setTimeout  `

  // setTimeout(() => {
  //   console.log(`test 23 `);
  // },0);

  const number = 10000
  let count = 0;

  // for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
  //   count ++
  //   console.log(count);
  // }


  const callStack = `
The call stack in JavaScript is a mechanism for managing function invocation.
When a function is called, a new frame (containing information about the function's execution context) is pushed onto the stack.
When the function completes, its frame is popped off the stack.
This follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, meaning the most recently added frame is the first to be removed.

first() is called and its frame is pushed onto the stack.
first() calls second(), which adds a new frame on top of the stack.
second() calls third(), adding another frame.
third() executes, logs the message, and its frame is popped off.
Control returns to second(), which completes and its frame is popped off.
Finally, first() completes and its frame is popped off.
  `
  function first() {
    second();
  }

  function second() {
    third();
  }

  //LIFO THE LAST FOO WILL BE EXECUTED FIRST
  function third() {
    console.log('Hello from the third function!');
  }

  first();

  const WEBAPI = `
   Web API in JavaScript refers to the set of APIs provided by the browser.
   These APIs include functionalities like DOM manipulation, making HTTP requests, handling timers, and more.
   WEBAPI's will be executed after simple synchronous code is removed from the callstack.
   WEBAPI functions can be multithreaded, they are written in other languages that is why after some async webapi foo is finished
   (for example data are fetched or timer is ready) they are moved to TASK QUEUE.
   Tas queue consists of all asynchronous callbacks. From here they are removed according to FIFO - First In First Out.
  `



      const RENDER_QUEUE = `
HAS HIGHER PRIORITY THAN TASK QUEUE
It is also executed until it is fully empty.

The term "render queue" is often used in the context of web development and browser internals to describe the process by which the browser manages rendering of the web page.
This involves the steps the browser takes to paint pixels to the screen, ensuring a smooth user experience. Here’s a simplified breakdown:
Render Queue in the Context of the Browser
JavaScript Execution: JavaScript code is executed, and any changes to the DOM or CSS are noted.
Style Calculation: The browser calculates the styles for each element based on the CSS.
Layout: The browser calculates the geometry of the elements (positions and sizes).
Paint: The browser determines which pixels need to be painted for the elements.
Composite: The browser composes the painted layers into the final screen image.

Interaction with the Call Stack and Event Loop
JavaScript Modifies the DOM: When JavaScript modifies the DOM, these modifications don’t immediately result in re-rendering.
Render Queue: The browser queues up these changes, optimizing to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Event Loop: After JavaScript execution, the event loop checks if the render queue has tasks.
Rendering Process: If there are tasks, the browser performs the style calculation, layout, paint, and composite steps to update the visual presentation.
      `

        const MICROTASKS_QUEUE = `
Immediate Execution: When a promise is created, the code inside the promise executor (the function passed to the Promise constructor) runs immediately.
Microtasks Queue: When a promise is resolved or rejected, its .then(), .catch(), and .finally() handlers are placed in the microtasks queue.
Event Loop: The event loop processes tasks in the microtasks queue before moving on to the next task in the task queue (which contains callbacks like those from setTimeout).
        `


  const EVENT_LOOP = `
    Event loop is working in the background all the time. It connects call stack with task queue.
    1. EVENT LOOP checks if CALL STACK is empty LIFO.
    2. MICROTASKS QUEUE until it's empty FIFO.
    3. RENDER QUEUE until it's empty
    5. If it is so it takes first foo from TASK QUEUE - only one and repeats.
    5. Repeat
