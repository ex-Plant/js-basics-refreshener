  const intro = `
    EcmaScript - a standardized language by the organization ECMA - JavaScript is its implementation.
    JavaScript origins - 1995.
    ECMA - European Computer Manufacturers Association.
    ECMAScript 6 - 2015
    Currently ES2023.

    JS engine
    Interpreted
    A JavaScript interpreter is a program that reads and interprets the code. For example, V8 in node.js.

    JS runtime environment - where the code is to be executed. The engine interprets, and the runtime provides objects that allow interaction with the outside world, e.g., window, DOM, etc.

    Chrome and Node.js use the same engine - V8, but they have different runtimes.
    In Chrome, thereâ€™s the window object and DOM, while in Node.js (on the server) there are functions like require, etc.
    Memory is managed by the garbage collector.
  `

  const variables = `
   Boxes in memory keeping some values.
   const - constans
   let, var - not constant

   1. Undeclared variable
   console.log(some_undeclared_variable)
   // ReferenceError: some_undeclared_variable is not defined

   2. Undefined variable - it has been declared but has no assigned value
   let undefined_variable; // declared
   console.log(undefined_variable) // undefined

   3. Defined variable - has been declared by using const, let or var and has a value assigned to it.
   let defined_var = 1 // declared and defined

   4. Global vars - vars available everywhere in the programme.

   5. Local vars - vars available only in a limited scope of a block of code.
   Local variables are created using let and const.

  `

  let a = 12;
  const txt = "Kasia";

  // block scope
  if (true) {
    let a = 100; // local vars
    let txt = "Zosia"; // this will replace the global var withing this block of code

    console.log(a); // 100
    console.log(txt); // Zosia
  }

  // back to global scope
  console.log(a); // 12
  console.log(txt); // Kasia


  // block scope
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    let a = 56;
    console.log("for", i, a);
    // for 0 56
    // for 1 56
    // for 2 56
  }

  const dynamicTyping = `
  *Dynamic Typing*
  JS is a dynamically typed language = you can changed the type of a variable during the course of the programme.
  THis is exactly the reason why TypeScript was developed.
  `

  const variableDeclaration = `
  * VARIABLE DECLARATION *
  - camelCase
  - snake_case
  - kebab-case
  - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

  To DECLARE A VARIABLE means to create a new one with an identifier, otherwise it would be undefined. We can also ASSIGN A VALUE to it.
  IDENTIFIER - name of a variable.
