  const VAR = `
  let and const were introduced with ES2015/ES2016.
  Before there was only var and this had many implications.
  `
  const notScoped = `
    1. Var IS NOT SCOPED!! Declaring a var means it is a global variable.
     If you do it inside a function and use the same name it will replacing the var declared outside this function.
  `
  var globalVariable = 1;
  // create a block scope
  if (true) {
    var globalVariable = 23; // overwriting a global
    console.log(globalVariable); // 23
  }

  var globalA = 10;

  if (true) {
    var globalA = 23;
    console.log(globalA); // 23

    var globalVarFromBlockScope = 100;
  }

  console.log(globalA); // 23
  console.log(globalVarFromBlockScope); // 100 - it is accessible outside


    const sameIdentifiers = `
    2. You can use the same identifier more than once without any errors - super dangerous.
   `
  var a = 12;
  var a = 45; // no error

  // let b = 12;
  // let b = 45; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared


  const varWithWindowObj = `
    3. with var we are effectively creating a global scope as we are in the window obj now and var has a function scope (window being the function)
  `

  var b = 10;
  console.log(window.b); // 10
  console.log(b); // 10
  console.log(window); // this object will have all global variables declared inside
