let theory = `
 let num = 12 is a statement,
 12 and num by themselves are expressions.
 An expression in JavaScript is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

let data = 10 + 7
The entire line let data = 10 + 7; is a statement because it declares a variable and assigns it a value.

The part 10 + 7 is an expression because it evaluates to a value, which in this case is 17.

console.log("informacja");
// function expression
