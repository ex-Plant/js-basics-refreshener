  const RECURSION =
          ` Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar sub-problems.
          Key Concepts in Recursion:

          Base Case: This is the condition that stops the recursion. Without it, the function would call itself indefinitely.
          Recursive Case: This is where the function calls itself, usually with a slightly simpler version of the problem.
          Progress Towards Base Case: Each recursive call should move closer to the base case.
          Stack: Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack. When the base case is reached, the stack unwinds, calculating the final result.

          `


  function countDown(n) {

    // base case
    if (n === 0) {
      console.log('done!');
      return
    }
    console.log(n);

    //recursive case
    countDown(n - 1)
  }

  countDown(5)

  const OUTPUT = `
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    Done!
  `


// Silnia = iloczyn wszystkich liczb naturalnych dodatnich nie większych niż n
  function factorial(n) {

    if (n < 0 ) {
      console.log(`n has to be greater than 0!`);
      return
    }

    // Base case
    if (n <= 1) {
      return 1;
    }

    // Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
    // 2 * 1 = 2 factorial(2)
    // 3 * 2 = 6 factorial(3)
    // 4 * 6 = 24 factorial (4)
    // 5 * 24 = 120 factorial (5)

  }

  console.log(factorial(5)); // Outputs: 120 5*4*3*2*!

  const EXPLANATION = `
  Call stack is crucial in recursion!!
  Until base case is reached another functions are added to the call stack.
  First function added there will be executed last according to FILO rule (first in last out).
  In our case where n initially is 5  factorial(5) will be called last.


   Let's trace factorial(5):

   1. Initial call: factorial(5)
   Call stack: [factorial(5)]
   5 is not 0 or 1, so we go to the recursive case
   We need to calculate 5 * factorial(4), but we don't know factorial(4) yet

   2. Second call: factorial(4)
   Call stack: [factorial(5), factorial(4)]
   4 is not 0 or 1, so again we go to the recursive case
   Now we need to calculate 4 * factorial(3)

   3. Third call: factorial(3)
   Call stack: [factorial(5), factorial(4), factorial(3)]
   3 is not 0 or 1, so we continue
   We need to calculate 3 * factorial(2)

   4. Fourth call: factorial(2)
   Call stack: [factorial(5), factorial(4), factorial(3), factorial(2)]
   2 is not 0 or 1, so one more recursive call
   We need to calculate 2 * factorial(1)

   5, Fifth call: factorial(1)
   Call stack: [factorial(5), factorial(4), factorial(3), factorial(2), factorial(1)]
   1 is one of our base cases, so we return 1

   Now, the call stack starts to unwind:

   5. Back to factorial(2):
   Call stack: [factorial(5), factorial(4), factorial(3), factorial(2)]
   We now know factorial(1) is 1, so we can compute
   2 * 1 = 2
   Return 2

   6. Back to factorial(3):
   Call stack: [factorial(5), factorial(4), factorial(3)]
   We now know factorial(2) is 2, so we compute
   3 * 2 = 6
   Return 6

   7. Back to factorial(4):
   Call stack: [factorial(5), factorial(4)]
   We now know factorial(3) is 6, so we compute
   4 * 6 = 24
   Return 24

   8. Finally, back to factorial(5):
   Call stack: [factorial(5)]
   We now know factorial(4) is 24, so we compute
   5 * 24 = 120
   Return 120
   The initial call completes, and 120 is our final answer.

   Why the call stack is crucial:
   State Preservation: Each call to factorial needs to remember its own 'n' value and where to return its result.
   The call stack keeps track of this for each recursive call.
   Order of Operations: The call stack ensures that the multiplications happen in the correct order, from innermost to outermost.
   Unwinding Process: As each call completes, it's removed from the stack, allowing the previous call to continue its computation with the returned value.
   Nested Computations: The call stack allows for these nested computations, where each level depends on the result of the level below it.
   Without the call stack, we would lose track of the intermediate steps and values necessary to compute the final result.
   The stack allows us to "pause" each function call while we compute the inner calls, and then "resume" with the results as we unwind.

  function sumArray(arr) {
    console.log(arr);
    //1. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    //2. [2, 3, 4, 5]
    //3. [3, 4, 5]
    //4. [4, 5]
    //5. [5]
    //6. [] // base case

    // we start with 0


    // 5 + 0 = 5 // arr[0] = 5
    // 4 + 5 = 9 // arr[0] = 4 and we add result from before
    // 3 + 9 = 12 // arr[0] = 3
    // 2 + 12 = 14
    // 1 + 14 = 15


    // base case
    if (arr.length === 0) {
      return 0
    }

    // recursive case
    return arr[0] + sumArray(arr.slice(1))

  }
  console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));

  const HOW_IT_WORKS = `
  If the array is empty, it returns 0 (base case).
  Otherwise, it returns the first element plus the sum of the rest of the array.
  This creates a chain of additions: 1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5 + 0)))).

  console.log(`ta da!`, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((acc, curr ) => {
    return acc + curr
  })); // 15

  console.log(`ta da!`, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((acc, curr ) => {
    return acc + curr
  },5)); // 20






  function foo(n) {

    foo(n)
  }

  foo(20)




  const anotherFactorialExample = (n) => {

    if (n === 1 || n === 0) {
      return 1
    }

    return n * anotherFactorialExample(n - 1)


    // 1 * 2 - 1 = 1
    // 2 *  2 - 1 = 2
    // 3 * 3 - 1 = 3 * 2 = 6


  }


  const test = anotherFactorialExample(3)
  console.log(test); // 6
