  const STRICT = `
  Strict mode helps in writing cleaner, more robust, and more secure JavaScript code.
  It is a good practice to use strict mode in your JavaScript programs to avoid common pitfalls and errors.
  "Strict mode" in JavaScript is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript, which helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions. It can be enabled by adding the string "use strict"; at the beginning of a script or function.
   Here are some key features and benefits of strict mode:

   Elimination of Some Silent Errors: Strict mode converts some silent errors into throw errors.
    For example, assigning a value to an undeclared variable will throw an error in strict mode.
  `
  x = 3.14; // Error: x is not defined

  "use strict";
  myVar = "Hello"; // Error: myVar is not defined

  "use strict";
  function sum(a, a, c) { // Error: Duplicate parameter name not allowed
    return a + a + c;
  }

  "use strict";
  function showThis() {
    console.log(this); // undefined
  }
  showThis();

  "use strict";
  // for example, using 'with' statement is not allowed
  with (Math) { x = cos(2); } // Error: Strict mode code may not include a with statement

  "use strict";
  var obj = {};
  Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", { value: 0, configurable: false });
  delete obj.x; // Error: Cannot delete property 'x' of #<Object>
