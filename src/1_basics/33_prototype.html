      JS does not have real classes like other programming languages. It has PROTOTYPES.
      INHERITANCE  exists only as prototype inheritance.
      Inheriting means sharing common functionalities for example methods from other objects.

      Everything in js except primitives are objects, including functions.
      Every function have methods, like call or apply, and property PROTOTYPE.

      By default a prototype is a empty object created during function definition.
      Every instance is created thanks to the same constructor, hence it will share common prototype.
