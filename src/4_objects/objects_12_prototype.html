      JS does not have real classes like other programming languages. It has PROTOTYPES.
      INHERITANCE  exists only as prototype inheritance.
      Inheriting means sharing common functionalities for example methods from other objects.

      Everything in js except primitives are objects, including functions.
      Every function have methods, like call or apply, and property PROTOTYPE.

      By default a prototype is a empty object created during function definition.
      Every instance is created thanks to the same constructor, hence it will share common prototype.

      After creating an instance we have access to internal properties of a constructor, in our case "name",
      but also to all properties defined in the prototype.
      In practice, prototype is simply a reference.
      These properties are not copied to each instance, instances simply have access to them and this is very good for performance.
      After adding some properties to constructor, each instance have access to them,
      even if they were added later on, during the course of the program after instance was created.

      Usually a better idea would be to add object methods to a prototype, not include them in the constructor.

      const __PROTO__ = `

      __proto__ points to a prototype of a given object. If it is not found it will be searched deeper.
      In practice __proto__ is a [[PROTOTYPE]] property, which is not accessible from js language. sic!
      This is all simply to understand how js works under the hood, we should not be using __proto__.
      Object will have access to prototype only if it was created using constructor, and "new" word,
      but evey object will have access to global prototype

      While accessing some property, this is what the JS interpreter does:
      1. Instance properties: The interpreter first looks for the property directly on the object instance.
      2. Prototype: If the property is not found on the instance, it looks in the object's prototype (which is the prototype property of the constructor function that created the object).
      3. Prototype Chain: If still not found, the search continues up the prototype chain. Each prototype object can have its own prototype, forming a chain.
      4. This search goes all the way up to the Object prototype.
      5. Global Methods: Methods like toString, hasOwnProperty, etc., arv e available because they are defined on Object.prototype, making them accessible to all objects.
